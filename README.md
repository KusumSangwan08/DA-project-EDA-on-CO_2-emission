# Data-Analysis-project-EDA-on-Co2-emission-from-1990-to-2022
In this project, I have done data analysis on Co2 emission during the period 1990-to-2022. The dataset used is available on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/global-fossil-co2-emissions-by-country-2002-2022). 

About the Dataset: This dataset provides an in-depth look into the global CO2 emissions at the country-level, allowing for a better understanding of how much each country contributes to the global cumulative human impact on climate. It contains information on total emissions as well as from coal, oil, gas, cement production and flaring, and other sources. The data also provides a breakdown of per capita CO2 emission per country - showing which countries are leading in pollution levels and identifying potential areas where reduction efforts should be concentrated. This dataset is essential for anyone who wants to get informed about their own environmental footprint or conduct research on international development trends.

Python Libraries used : numpy , pandas , seaborn , plotly , matplotlib
